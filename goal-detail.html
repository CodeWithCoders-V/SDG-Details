                        <p>Despite significant progress in reducing global poverty—more than halving poverty rates since 2000—there is still a long way to go. Around one in ten people in developing regions live on less than the international poverty line of US$1.90 per day, with millions more earning just slightly above this amount. While Eastern and Southeastern Asia have seen major advancements, poverty remains a critical issue, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where up to 42% of the population still lives below the poverty line.
Poverty is not simply the absence of income. It extends to a lack of access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, healthcare, and education. It also encompasses social exclusion, hunger, malnutrition, and the inability to participate in decision-making processes. These barriers prevent individuals and communities from thriving and fully contributing to society.
To end poverty, we need more than just economic growth; we need inclusive economic growth that benefits everyone, especially the most vulnerable. Creating sustainable job opportunities, providing access to education and skills development, and ensuring fair wages are essential steps in lifting people out of poverty. This approach can break the cycle of poverty and help families build a better future.
Moreover, social protection systems are critical in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable populations, particularly in disaster-prone regions. These systems provide safety nets that help people recover from economic shocks and disasters, preventing them from falling deeper into poverty. When implemented effectively, social protection systems strengthen communities' resilience and can help end extreme poverty, even in the most impoverished areas.
Health and Nutrition are key components in fighting poverty. Healthy children and families contribute to increased prosperity, and immunization plays a vital role in this. Vaccines not only prevent diseases that could otherwise be fatal, but they also support proper nutrition by helping children avoid illnesses that impair nutrient absorption. Malnourished children are far more vulnerable to diseases like diarrhoea, measles, and pneumonia—many of which can be prevented through vaccination. By combining immunization with nutrition interventions, we can reduce child mortality, improve overall health outcomes, and set the foundation for stronger, more prosperous communities.
The ultimate goal of the No Poverty SDG is to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to live a life of dignity, free from the constraints of poverty. This can only be achieved by addressing the root causes of poverty, creating opportunities for economic participation, and ensuring access to health, education, and social protection for all.
